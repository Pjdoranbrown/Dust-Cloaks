## Troubleshooting

**Nothing loads?**
→ Make sure ALL 12 image files are in the folder with the code files

**Buttons don't work?**
→ You MUST use a web server (can't just open index.html)
→ Use one of the methods above

**Works locally but not on GitHub?**
→ Wait 5 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
→ Check you uploaded ALL files (16 code files + 12 images)
